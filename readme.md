# SIFT

## About
Sift is a multi-threaded regex pattern finding tool capable of scanning most popular file types. It can scan for multiple patterns, and patterns are encrypted and saved to a config file for convenience.

For a scan to run:
- At least one pattern needs to be defined
- At least one root directory needs to be defined
- Output directory must be defined
